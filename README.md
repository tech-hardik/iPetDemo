A pet app created using SwiftUI and UserDefaults. Every 10 seconds, the pet's hunger and thirst levels change, which also changes its happiness levels.
It was one of my first iOS projects, its silly but fun to use.

# When its hunger and thirst are satisfied, the pet is happy.

# The pet starts "Getting Hungry" after 15 seconds but still remains happy.

# As soon as the pet becomes hungry or thirsty, it becomes upset.

# We can feed it food or give it water to make it happy again.
